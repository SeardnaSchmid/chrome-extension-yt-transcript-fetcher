# Privacy Policy for YouTube Transcript & Summary Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Overview

This privacy policy describes how the YouTube Transcript & Summary Chrome Extension ("we", "our", or "us") handles information when you use our extension.

## Information We Access

### Website Content
- **YouTube Transcripts**: We access transcript content from YouTube videos to enable copying functionality
- **No Personal Data**: We do not access, collect, or store any personal information about you

## Information We Store Locally

The extension stores the following preferences locally in your browser:

- **Interface Language**: Your preferred language (English, Portuguese, Spanish)
- **Prompt Settings**: Your preferred prompt types and AI service selections
- **Text Splitting Options**: Your character limit preferences for different AI models
- **Timestamp Preferences**: Whether to include or exclude timestamps in copied transcripts

**Important**: All data is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this information.

## How We Use Information

- **Transcript Access**: Only to enable the copy functionality you request
- **Local Storage**: Only to remember your preferences for future use
- **No Data Collection**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information

## Third-Party Services

When you choose to auto-paste to AI services (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, GitHub Copilot), the transcript content is sent directly to those services. We do not have access to or control over how those services handle your data.

## Data Security

- All data remains on your local device
- No data is transmitted to our servers
- No data is shared with third parties (except when you explicitly choose to use AI services)
- We use Chrome's built-in storage APIs for local data persistence

## Your Rights

- **Local Control**: You can clear all stored preferences through Chrome's extension settings
- **No Data Collection**: Since we don't collect personal data, there's no data to request, modify, or delete
- **Transparency**: All extension functionality is open source and auditable

## Children's Privacy

Our extension does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.
